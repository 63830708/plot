### axis refactoring (branch layoutsystem):

> layout system
 > fix legend according to new system
 - add QCPLayoutInset (maybe a QCPLayoutElement in back and front?) (maybe call it QCPLayoutOverlay?)
 - Create QCPLayoutElement subclass that represents a plot title. How to get it drawn? Items?
 - adapt QCustomPlot methods that were based on old axis system (handleAxisSelection and selectedAxes done)
 
- provide way to get the QCPAxisRect a QPoint is on.

- add setPlotLayout? should destroy old layout
- update all the documentation referencing QCustomPlot::setMargin, QCustomPlot::setAutoMargin, QCustomPlot::axisRect
- check whether selection boxes of axes are properly positioned (also with rotated tick labels!)
- remove delete legend from QCP dtor after legend integrated into layout system
- make sure legend QCPLayoutElement passes the layout as parent of QCPLayerable (currently set to parentPlot)

doc:
- emphasize in documentation for QCPLayoutGrid::removeElement that only a call to simplify() will actually remove empty rows/columns
