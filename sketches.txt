### axis refactoring (branch layoutsystem):

- update all the documentation referencing QCustomPlot::setMargin, QCustomPlot::setAutoMargin, QCustomPlot::axisRect

- minimum sizes of layout element is ignored in favor of minimumSizeHint differently for inset layout and for grid layout. Inset ignores if size is invalid, grid always
  uses it as upper bound of minimum size. (Did it like that because grid sometimes wants to control x/y independently, e.g. restrict x by setting high minimum width but
  leaving y free by setting it to 0.)
  That's inconsistent internally and in comparison with how Qt does it.
- write test for QCPLayoutGrid::insertRow/Column
- remove QCustomPlot::setColor and introduce QCustomPlot::setBackground (just like QCPAxisRect, with pixmap option)

- clean up QCustomPlot ctor
- make uniform header commenting scheme for class definitions ("non-property methods", "introduced virtual functions", ...)

doc:
- emphasize in documentation for QCPLayoutGrid::removeElement that only a call to simplify() will actually remove empty rows/columns
- document selectionChanged signal of QCPLayerable
