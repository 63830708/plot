/*! \class QCPLayer
  \brief A layer that may contain objects, to control the rendering order
  
  The Layering system of QCustomPlot is the mechanism to control the rendering order of the
  elements inside the plot, e.g. that the grid is drawn behind plottables etc.
  
  It is based on the two classes QCPLayer and QCPLayerable. A QCustomPlot contains an ordered list
  of one or more instances of QCPLayer (see QCustomPlot::addLayer, QCustomPlot::layer,
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer, etc.). The layers are drawn in the order they are in the list.

  A QCPLayer itself contains an ordered list of QCPLayerable instances. QCPLayerable is an abstract
  base class from which almost all visible objects derive, like axes, grids, graphs, items, etc.
  
  By default, QCustomPlot has three layers: "grid", "main" and "axes" (in that order). Initially
  the QCPGrid instances are on the "grid" layer, so the grid will be drawn beneath the objects on
  the other two layers. The top layer is "axes" and contains all four axes, so they will be drawn
  on top. Between these two layers, there is the "main" layer. It is initially empty and set as the
  current layer (see QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer). This means, all new plottables, items etc.
  are created on this layer by default, and are thus drawn above the grid but below the axes.
  
  Controlling the ordering of objects is easy: Create a new layer in the position you want it to
  be, e.g. above "main", with QCustomPlot::addLayer. Then set the current layer with
  QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer to that new layer and finally create the objects normally. They will
  be placed on the new layer automatically, due to the current layer setting. Alternatively you
  could have also ignored the current layer setting and just moved the objects with
  QCPLayerable::setLayer to the desired layer after creating them.
  
  It is also possible to move whole layers. For example, If you want the grid to be shown in front
  of all plottables/items on the "main" layer, just move it above "main" with
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer. This way the ordering might now be "main", "grid", "axes", so while the
  grid will still be beneath the axes, it will now be drawn above plottables/items on "main", as
  intended.
  
  The rendering order within one layer is simply by order of creation. The item created last (or
  added last to the layer), is drawn on top of all other objects on that layer.  
  
  When a layer is deleted, the objects on it are not deleted with it, but fall on the layer below
  the deleted layer, see QCustomPlot::removeLayer.

  \brief Base class for all objects that can be placed on layers
  
  This is the abstract base class most visible objects derive from, e.g. plottables, axes, grid

/*! \fn virtual void QCPLayerable::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint(QCPPainter *painter) const = 0
  \internal
  
  This function applies the default antialiasing setting to the specified \a painter, using the
  function \ref applyAntialiasingHint. This is the antialiasing state the painter is in, when \ref
  draw is called on the layerable. If the layerable has multiple entities whose antialiasing
  setting may be specified individually, this function should set the antialiasing state of the
  most prominent entity. In this case however, the \ref draw function usually calls the specialized
  versions of this function before drawing each entity, effectively overriding the setting of the
  default antialiasing hint.
  
  <b>First example:</b> QCPGraph has multiple entities that have an antialiasing setting: The graph
  line, fills, scatters and error bars. Those can be configured via QCPGraph::setAntialiased,
  QCPGraph::setAntialiasedFill, QCPGraph::setAntialiasedScatters etc. Consequently, there isn't
  only the QCPGraph::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint function (which corresponds to the graph line's
  antialiasing), but specialized ones like QCPGraph::applyFillAntialiasingHint and
  QCPGraph::applyScattersAntialiasingHint. So before drawing one of those entities, QCPGraph::draw
  calls the respective specialized applyAntialiasingHint function.
  
  <b>Second example:</b> QCPItemLine consists only of a line so there is only one antialiasing
  setting which can be controlled with QCPItemLine::setAntialiased. (This function is inherited by
  all layerables. The specialized functions, as seen on QCPGraph, must be added explicitly to the
  respective layerable subclass.) Consequently it only has the normal
  QCPItemLine::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint. The \ref QCPItemLine::draw function doesn't need to
  care about setting any antialiasing states, because the default antialiasing hint is already set
  on the painter when the \ref draw function is called, and that's the state it wants to draw the
  line with.
