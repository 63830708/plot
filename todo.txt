NEXT RELEASE:

> make uniform header commenting scheme for class definitions ("non-property methods", "introduced virtual functions", ...)
  - have items, layoutelements, plottables and axis.h
  
- Make example line plot with white-filled circles and a non-white background.
- Experiment with better styled background, Gradients/patterns
- Ask for permission to add to http://qt-project.org/faq/answer/do_you_provide_a_tool_for_creating_graphs

doc:
- duplicate QCPAbstractPlottable::rescaleAxes documentation in QCPGraph::rescaleAxes reimplementations. and make cross references between
  QCustomPlot::/QCPGraph::/QCPAbstractPlottable::rescaleAxes 
- add doc-note and qDebug output for case when addToLegend (QCPGraph/QCPAbstractPlottable) is called without the plottable being in the plot. 
- explain ltDateTime mode on axes better. Probably give examples with numbers
  

FUTURE RELEASE:

- alternating axis section backgrounds
- Item class based on tracer which adds tag-like labels to points. With option to show x/y values via formatting strings (%key and %value).
- Range navigation via selection rectangle
- optimize QCPGraph (and QCPCurve) with improved intersection clip algorithm (keep old algo for timing). QCPGraph will need clipping on left and right
  only for first and last segment due to the sorted underlying QCPDataMap. Watch out for regression for lsImpulse... (shouldn't happen since we work on raw line data)
  - increase the intersection rect by mScatterSize
  - make QCPCurve::drawScatterPlot only draw scatters that are actually in cliprect.
- colors of line and fill of QCPGraph dependant on sign of data. Settable via overloaded setters with two arguments.
- fix selection area for bracket (doesn't adapt to length, probably need style specific algorithms)
- make demo with TeXGyreTermes axis fonts/text/arrows etc.
- make type and parent of QCPItemPosition individual for key and value, but keep interface that sets them simultaneously
- QCPItemPolygon // hide the QCPItemPosition list behind QCPItemPosition &point(i), pointCount(), setPointCount(c) interface.
- layer visibility
- maybe adjust getKeyRange on QCPGraph in sdBoth mode to actually use the sorted fashion of map (just look at first and last)
- think about how to realize splitted axes in the future
- QCPCandlesticks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart)
- QCPBubbles (x, y, area)

- QCPBars value error bars, print values above bars, maybe print per bar text inside bar (rotated)
- somehow, range checks must be aware of the scale type used (if that's done, fix the validRange function for log plot 1e-300-1e300)
- provide a way to set axes ranges with 1:1 ratio (via signals/slots? review setScaleRatio)
- Data fetcher
- make drawScatterPlot more efficient
  In total, we calculate the coordToPixel transformation for the .key and .value
  three times (for polygon line, for error and for scatter). Maybe provide the
  polygon data here and make this function aware of at which increments the
  data points are positioned in the polygon (depends on line style!).
- Fix for N900 error for pen width 0 (perhaps with Q_OS_SYMBIAN flag in QCPPainter?)
